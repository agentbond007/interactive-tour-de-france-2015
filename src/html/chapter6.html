	Many Dutch fans arrive for race day to enjoy the action on the Dutch Mountain, so called after a string of stage winners from the Netherlands in the 1970s and 80s. A dense crowd of orange now packs the streets and hills along the route. The Alpe dâ€™Huez office de tourisme was originally cautious on paying to host the stage but now does so willingly, citing millions of euros of annual economic boost.
