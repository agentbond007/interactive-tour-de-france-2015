<h2>Taking it on</h2>

<p>
	The climb is a long, consistently steep ascent, and riders require a steady pacing over 40-45 minutes of output. Brief flatter sections offer some relief, as does each bend’s more gradual outer line if a dense swathe of fans doesn’t cover it. But the steepest parts present the greatest opportunity for riders to eke out gains and join the famous names to have won a Tour stage on Alpe d’Huez.
