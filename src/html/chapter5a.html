	The flat summit finish offers a welcome relief after the demanding ascent, but there is still nearly 1km to ride to the line on Avenue de Rif Nel. In 1999, among the chaotic support, a camera-wielding spectator knocked down runaway leader Guiseppe Guerini as he neared the peak. The Italian still managed to pick himself up to win the stage.
