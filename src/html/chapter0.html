<h2>Historic ascent</h2>

<p>
	It may not be as high or historic as Col du Tourmalet, nor as far to climb as Mont Ventoux, but Alpe d'Huez has developed its own folklore. It is the iconic Tour de France mountain to conquer. As riders pass each of its famous 21 bends they see the names of winners gone before. Hundreds of thousands of frenetic fans create what 1992 stage winner Andy Hampsten described as "more cycling stadium than beautiful road".
